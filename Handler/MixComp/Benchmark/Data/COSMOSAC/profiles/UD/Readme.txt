This database contains the COSMO files of 2261 compounds determined using DMol3 (implemented in Materials Studio of Accelrys/Biovia/Dassault) as reported in
R Fingerhut, W-L Chen, A Schedemann, W Cordes, J Rarey, C-M Hsieh, J Vrabec, and S-T Lin,
"Comprehensive Assessment of COSMO-SAC Models for Predictions of Fluid-Phase Equilibria" Ind. Eng. Chem. Res., 2017
(DOI: 10.1021/acs.iecr.7b01360) (ref 1)

The users are referred to ref. 3 for the detailed procedure of generating the COSMO files.

This database can be freely used for non-profit, academic purposes. Re-distribution of the database without the concent of the authors is prohibited.

The directory contain COSMO files of 2261 compounds, of which
1941 compounds were obtained from UD (referred to as the UD database)
 320 compounds generated by the authors of ref. 1 based on the initial structure determined from DDBST
The file "compoundlist" contains a list of compound names, CAS numbers, and the corresponding filenames.

The UD database was obtained from Sandler's group at the University of Delaware
who developed the database in cooperation with Dr. S. Lustig at Northeastern University (formerly of DuPont).
The UD database is an extension of the freely available VT-database (ref. 2 and 3) with corrections to the
molecular conformations for about 1/3 of compounds based on vapor pressure predictions (ref. 4).
