This file summarizes all the functions for setting up the various 
activity-coefficient-model handlers.

Functions overview:
    Experiments = load_Experiments(name_group, fit_extrapolation)
    Order_Fit = load_OrderOfFit(name_group)
    Data = load_Data(name_group)
    Database = load_Database(name_group)

# %% IMPORT PACKAGES
'''
Program libraries with modules that are used within the script are shown below.
Either the entire library or only individual modules are loaded.
'''
# builds and contains data structures and operators for accessing numeric tables
import pandas as pd

'''
In this function, experiments are imported from Excel tables
Input:
        - name_group: group of solutes so that the right file can be loaded
    - fit_extrapolation: choose wheter the test or trainings set should be considered
Output:
        - Experiments: Experiments for the group and either fit or extrapolation

    # Columns: Temperature in Â°C, solvent name, solute name, solubility
